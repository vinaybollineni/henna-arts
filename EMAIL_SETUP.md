# Email Contact Form Setup Guide 📧

Your website now has email functionality integrated using **Formspree**, a free service that sends form submissions directly to your email.

## Current Status

✅ The form is configured to send submissions  
✅ Emails will be sent to: **meghnahennaart@gmail.com**  
⚠️ You need to verify your email with Formspree on first submission

## How It Works

1. Visitor fills out the contact form on your website
2. They click "Send Message"
3. Formspree processes the form
4. You receive an email at **meghnahennaart@gmail.com** with all the details
5. You can reply directly to the visitor's email

## First Time Setup (Important!)

### Step 1: Receive First Submission
When someone fills out your form for the first time (or you test it yourself):

1. They'll see a message: "Sending your message..."
2. Formspree will redirect them to a confirmation page
3. **You'll receive an email** asking you to confirm your email address

### Step 2: Confirm Your Email
1. Check your inbox at **meghnahennaart@gmail.com**
2. Look for an email from Formspree
3. Click the confirmation link
4. After confirmation, all future form submissions will be automatically sent to you!

## Testing Your Form

### Test It Yourself:
1. Go to your website: https://vinaybollineni.github.io/henna-arts/
2. Scroll to the "Get In Touch" section
3. Fill out the form with test information
4. Click "Send Message"
5. Check your email inbox!

## What You'll Receive

Each form submission will include:

```
From: [Visitor's Name]
Email: [Visitor's Email]
Phone: [Visitor's Phone]
Service: [Selected Service Type]
Message: [Their Message]
```

You can reply directly to these emails, and the visitor will receive your response!

## Alternative: Create Your Own Formspree Account (Optional)

If you want more control and analytics, you can create a free Formspree account:

### Steps:
1. Go to https://formspree.io/
2. Click "Sign Up" (free account)
3. Log in with your email: meghnahennaart@gmail.com
4. Create a new form
5. Copy your form endpoint (looks like: `https://formspree.io/f/xxxxxxxx`)
6. Let me know the endpoint and I'll update the website code

### Benefits of Having Your Own Account:
- Dashboard to view all submissions

## Free Plan Limits

Formspree free plan includes:

This is perfect for a small business! If you get more than 50 inquiries per month, you can upgrade or switch to a paid plan.

## Troubleshooting

### Not Receiving Emails?

1. **Check Spam/Junk Folder**
   - Formspree emails might go to spam initially
   - Mark them as "Not Spam" to receive future emails in inbox

2. **Verify Email Confirmation**
   - Make sure you clicked the confirmation link in the first email from Formspree

3. **Test the Form**
   - Fill it out yourself to ensure it's working
   - Use a different email address as the sender

4. **Check Email Address**
   - Verify meghnahennaart@gmail.com is correct and accessible

### Form Not Submitting?

1. Make sure all fields are filled out
2. Check that the email format is valid
3. Try a different browser
4. Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)

## Alternative: Direct Email Link

If you prefer, visitors can also:
- Click your email address anywhere on the site
- This opens their default email client
- They can email you directly

The contact form is better because:
- ✅ Easier for visitors (no email client needed)
- ✅ Structured information (name, phone, service type)
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ✅ Works on all devices

## Security Features

✅ Spam protection built-in  
✅ HTTPS encrypted submissions  
✅ No visitor data stored on your website

2. Enable push notifications for Gmail
3. You'll get instant alerts for new form submissions

### For Android:
1. Gmail app should notify you automatically
2. Check notification settings if needed
