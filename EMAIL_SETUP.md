# Email Contact Form Setup Guide 📧

Your website now has email functionality integrated using **FormSubmit**, a free service that sends form submissions directly to your email.

## Current Status

✅ The form is configured to send submissions  
✅ Emails will be sent to: **meghnahennaart@gmail.com**  
✅ No signup or verification required - works immediately!

## How It Works

1. Visitor fills out the contact form on your website
2. They click "Send Message"
3. FormSubmit processes the form instantly
4. You receive an email at **meghnahennaart@gmail.com** with all the details
5. The visitor sees a success confirmation page
6. You can reply directly to the visitor's email

## First Time Setup

### VERY IMPORTANT - One-Time Verification:

When you receive the **very first** form submission (test it yourself!):

1. **You'll receive an email from FormSubmit** with the subject: "Activate Form"
2. **Click the activation link** in that email
3. After clicking, all future submissions will arrive automatically!
4. You only need to do this ONCE

**Without clicking the activation link, the form won't work!**

## Testing Your Form

### Test It Yourself:
1. Go to your website: https://vinaybollineni.github.io/henna-arts/
2. Scroll to the "Get In Touch" section
3. Fill out the form with test information
4. Click "Send Message"

Each form submission will include:

```
From: [Visitor's Name]
Email: [Visitor's Email]

## Troubleshooting

### Not Receiving Emails?

1. **Check Spam/Junk Folder**
   - Formspree emails might go to spam initially
   - Mark them as "Not Spam" to receive future emails in inbox

2. **Activate FormSubmit**
   - Make sure you clicked the activation link in the first email from FormSubmit
   - This is the MOST COMMON reason forms don't work!

3. **Test the Form**
   - Fill it out yourself to ensure it's working
   - Use a different email address as the sender

4. **Check Email Address**
   - Verify meghnahennaart@gmail.com is correct and accessible

### Form Not Submitting?

1. Make sure all fields are filled out
2. Check that the email format is valid
3. Try a different browser
4. Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)

## Alternative: Direct Email Link
